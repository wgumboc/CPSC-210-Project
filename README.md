# CPSC 210 Project by William Gumboc

## Manning Schedule Creator

As a previous Quality Control Supervisor at PepsiCo. I was in charge of managing 25 front line employees. There was no 
scheduling software, and creating the schedule involved manipulating an Excel spreadsheet, leading to various mistakes. 
These mistakes included scheduling an employee in area in which they do not possess the skills and having a gap
in positions required to be filled. This application serves to simplify the process by attributing skills to various 
employees, visually showing the user which positions need to be filled, and alerting the user if there is a 
skills-position mismatch.
