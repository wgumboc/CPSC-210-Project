# CPSC 210 Project by William Gumboc

## Manning Schedule Creator

As a previous Quality Control Supervisor at PepsiCo. I was in charge of managing 25 front line employees. Part of
this role included creating a manning schedule that:
1. Filled all required positions with the appropriate personnel. 
2. Adhered to union rules.
3. Respected shift and role preferences based on seniority. 

There was no scheduling software, and creating the schedule involved manipulating an Excel spreadsheet, leading
to various mistakes. These mistakes included: scheduling an employee in area in which they do not possess the skills, having a gap
in positions required to be filled, and not scheduling all employees. This application serves to simplify the process
by attributing skills to various employees, visually showing the user which positions need to be filled, alerting
the user if there is a skills-position mismatch, and altering the user if an employee has not been scheduled.
